@chapin_reconciling_2006 is a helpful resource that clarifies some key terms and concepts that are used to discuss carbon exchange.  Different fields have different conventions (e.g. micrometeorology vs ecology) and it can get pretty confusing when you're reading literature from a mix of fields or trying to write to a broad audience.  

## NEP vs. NEE

To highlight the mix up, lets compare net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE).  

* **NEP** is the difference between ecosystem scale photosynthesis and respiration: $NEP = GPP - ER$ [e.g., @lovett_is_2006]
  * **GPP**: Gross primary production - photosynthetic uptake of $CO_2$
  * **ER**: The sum of Autotrophic (AR) and Heterotrophic (HR) respiration, i.e., the total aerobic respiration of $CO_2$ by an ecosystem.
    * AR: plants
    * HR: everything else

* **NEE** is net flux of $CO_2$ *observed* between an ecosystem and the atmosphere.  It is frequently defined as NEE = ER - GPP [e.g.,@aubinet_eddy_2012].  This would define NEE as the inverse of NEP.  But strictly speaking, this is not true.
  * At small spatial scales and over short timescales $NEP \approx -NEE$ @baldocchi_assessing_2003 
  * But over larger/longer scales they diverge because NEE does not account fluxes of dissolved $CO_2$.
    * If respiration derived $CO_2$ is transported out of an ecosystem in ground water, its not *observed* by eddy covariance methods but its still part of NEP

* The key distinction: NEE is a property we directly measure with eddy covariance (or chambers), NEP is a value we can calculate if we known GPP and **total** ER.

## The NECB

@chapin_reconciling_2006 define the term net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) to describe the sum of all components of the carbon (C) balance for an ecosystem. The NECB includes:

* Both all sinks and sources of both organic and inorganic C
  * Natural **b** anthropogenic in origin
* Fluxes of C via numerous pathways:
  * Terrestrial &harr; atmospheric
  * Terrestrial &harr; aquatic
  * Bulk/particulate transport

The NECB is a <b>broad</b> concept, we can't measure it completely with micrometeorologic methods alone.  It represents the net change in ecosystem C per unit time.  The sign convention is **opposite** of what micrometeorologists often use.  Positive (+) accumulation of C **in** the ecosystem, Negative (-) loss of C **from** the ecosystem.

$$
NECB = \frac{dC}{dt}
$$

## Components of the NECB

$$
NECB = -NEE + F_{CO} + F_{CH4} + F_{VOC} + F_{DIC} + F_{DOC} + F_{PC}
$$

* NEE: Net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide ($CO_2$)
  * Ecosystem &harr; atmosphere $CO_2$ fluxes
  * Sign convention is opposite of NECB
* $F_{CO}$: Fluxes of carbon monoxide (CO)
  * Anthropogenic systems (e.g., combustion engines) and forest fires are the primary sources of CO
  * Soils are fairly strong CO sinks depending on temperature, most uptake occurs in the tropics @cowan_seasonal_2018
* $F_{CH4}$: Fluxes of methane (CH4)</li>
  * Ecosystem &harr; atmosphere $CO_4$ fluxes
  * A significant component of the NECB in many wetland ecosystems (e.g., @lai_methane_2009; @serrano-silva_methanogenesis_2014)
  * Especially important for GHG budgets because it has a global warming potential 27 times that of $CO_2$ on a 100 yr timescale (@masson-delmotte_climate_2021)
* $F_{VOC}$: Fluxes of volatile organic compounds (VOC)
  * Organic compounds (e.g., isoprene) are emitted by living plants
  * Small, but non-negligible contributions - isoprene fluxes were less 0.5% the magnitude of NEE in a temperate poplar forest @portillo-estrada_contribution_2018
* $F_{DIC}$ & $F_{DOC}$: Fluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
  * DIC - Primarily dissolved $CO_2$ in most systems, but can also include dissolved $CH_4$, e.g., in peatlands (@waddington_groundwater_1997 @dinsmore_role_2010; @campeau_multiple_2017)
  * DOC - More complex organic compounds (e.g., root exudates)
  * Varies drastically by ecosystem and timescale.  In the Alaskan Arctic, dissolved C (DIC + DOC) are estimated to offset between 7% and 20% of NEP annual @kling_arctic_1991; a literature review found proportions of NEP offset by dissolved C fluxes ranged from <1% in a boreal forest to 590% in a freshwater marsh @webb_importance_2019.
* $F_{PC}$: Fluxes of bulk/particulate carbon (PC)
  * A bit of a catch all - flux of particulate carbon can include everything from erosion/deposition of organic matter to animal droppings (C deposition) or timber harvesting (bulk C removal)
  * Spatially and temporally variable - heavily dependent upon the system you're looking at.
